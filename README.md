60 days of Udacity challenge: federated leaning and differential privacy mini-projects

# KeyStone Project overview
Basic idea: implement the federated learning and differential privacy with a real web and mobile app, using a trained model in Pytorch.

Step 1: Train a Pytorch model with flower dataset. (day 11-12)
I have trained two models during the Pytorch Challenge and the Bossom Challenge during the Private AI course

Step 2: Create a Web app
I have created a basic web app with Flask with a post API (day 15)

Step 3: Create a mobile app (day 16)
create a simple app that loads an image and predict the flower name
- create the app
- convert the pytorch model to Caffe2 or find a solution for loding a model into Android
- also possible: implement PySyft
- load the model in the mobile app to show the prediction
